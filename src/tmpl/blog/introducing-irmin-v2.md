We are pleased to announce [Irmin
2.0.0](https://github.com/mirage/irmin/releases), a major release of the
Git-like distributed branching and storage substrate that underpins MirageOS.
We began the release process for all the components that make up Irmin [back in
May 2019](https://tarides.com/blog/2019-05-13-on-the-road-to-irmin-v2), and
there have been close to 1000 commits since Irmin 1.4.0 release back in June
2018. To celebrate this milestone, we have a new logo and opened a dedicated
website: [irmin.org](https://irmin.org).

You can read more details about the new features in the [Irmin v2 blog
post](https://tarides.com/blog/2019-11-21-irmin-v2).  Enjoy the new release,
and stay tuned for the upcoming Wodan integration in 2020 that will be a stable
filesystem for the hypervisor targets for MirageOS that do not have a
conventional OS kernel underneath them!
